Try to use contrastive learning to train a network to transform encoded new embeddings to the final representation.

See is there any error in the training code along the following steps.
1. more complex projection net?
2. different loss function for contrastive loss?
3. Labels from stock correlation?
4. element-wise production? (other fusion method that resists missing values)
5. boosting, bagging
